<p>
		<strong>Declarative programming</strong> - programming paradigm that expresses logic of computation without
		describing its' control flow
</p>

<p>
		<strong>Functional programming</strong> - type of declarative programming in which
		programs are made of pure functions
</p>

<p>
		<strong>Pure function</strong> - function that doesn't have side-effects and always
		gives same output with same input
</p>

<p><strong>Procedure</strong> - impure function</p>

<p>
		<strong>Imperative programming</strong> - programming paradigm that uses statements that change program’s state
</p>

<p>
		<strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong> - type of imperative programming
		in which programs are made of classes
</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong> - object with context, constructor method and data fields</p>

<ul>
