      <b>Try-Catch</b> - mechanism of error handling in JS, when it tries to
      execute code, then, if it doesn't succeed, catches possible error and,
      finally, runs some code, e. g.<code>try { a() } catch (e) { console.log(e) } finally { console.log('done')
        }</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Promise</b> - object with unique methods like<code>then</code><code>catch</code>that is returned by async
      function and is used to
      notify that it's execution is completed
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Await</b> - mechanism that executed code after some promise by async
      function is returned, e. g.<code>var result = await new Promise()</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Asynchronous JavaScript And XML (AJAX)</b> - technique that allows
      making HTTP requests directly from scripts. e. g.
      <code>fetch('http://example.com/data.json').then(response =>
        response.json())</code>
    </p>

      <b>Bubbling</b> - principle in JS, where events are captured from deepest
      element to all of it's parents recursively

        are committed to the DOM

        props trigger re-render

        processed by a component

      <b>Vuex</b> - mutable Vue state container, where global state of app
      consists of a global storage of all data, methods that alter that storage
      via<code>commit</code>to<code>$store</code>context, and components that
